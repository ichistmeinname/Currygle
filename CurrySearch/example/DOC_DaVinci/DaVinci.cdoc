(CurryInfo (ModuleInfo "DaVinci" "Johannes Koj (with modifications by Michael Hanus)" "Binding for the daVinci graph visualization tool.\n\nThis library supports the visualization of graphs by the\n[daVinci graph drawing tool](http://www.tzi.de/daVinci/)\nthrough the following features:\n\n  * Graphs are displayed by the main functions\n    dvDisplay or dvDisplayInit\n\n  * Graphs to be displayed are constructed by the functions:\n\n    dvNewGraph:      takes a list of nodes to construct a graph\n\n    dvSimpleNode:    a node without outgoing edges\n\n    dvNodeWithEdges: a node with a list of outgoing edges\n\n    dvSimpleEdge:    an edge to a particular node\n\n    The constructors dvSimpleNode/dvNodeWithEdges/dvSimpleEdge\n    have a graph identifier (type DvId) as a first argument.\n    This identifier is a free variable (since type DvId is abstract)\n    and can be used in other functions to refer to this node or edge.\n  * The constructor functions for graph entities take an event handler\n    (of type \"DvWindow -> Success\") as the last argument.\n    This event handler is executed whenever the user clicks on the\n    corresponding graph entity.\n  * There are a number of predefined event handlers to manipulate\n    existing graphs (see functions dvSetNodeColor, dvAddNode, dvSetEdgeColor,\n    dvAddEdge, dvDelEdge, dvSetClickHandler).\n    dvEmptyH is the \"empty handler\" which does nothing.\n\nFor a correct installation of this library, the constant `dvStartCmd`\ndefined below must be correctly set to start your local installation\nof DaVinci.\n\n")
